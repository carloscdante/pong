## PONG - Pretty Obsolete and Not Good (Game)

![](./scr.png)

Really bad recreation of Pong in pygame. It supports 2 players (on one machine)
and has pretty much only the base game and sound with a basic score counter. I don't know Python,
GUI Programming, let alone game programming, this is supposed to be a crude learning project.

I have yet to learn collision detection and how to implement newtonian physics in games. Both
the collision detection and the physics are from really bad to non-existent.

## How to run

Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/carloscdante/pong`, enter the src directory and run it with
`python3 game.py`.

## Controls

A-Z for the player 1, Key up and key down for player 2.
